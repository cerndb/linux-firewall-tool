Linux Firewall Tool
===================

Summary
=======
The current tool is managing **iptables**, **ip6tables** using **ipsets**. It is created to simplify the Linux firewall
configuration at CERN IT Databases Group. It is intended to help SysAdmins that manage firewalls and make changes
regularly. It works by parsing simple **.ini** files which include the configuration in order to build the iptables
rules and kernel ipesets.
